<span>Why we Use Random Forest</span>
- It takes less cmp to other algo.
- It predict Output with High Accuracy.
- It handle missing data as well as accuracy

<span>How Does Random Forest Algorithm Work</span>
<li> Select random k data points from the training set </li>
<li>Build the decison trees associated with selected data points</li>
<li>Choose the number n for decison trees that you want to build</li>
<li> Repeat step 1&2 </li>
<li> For New Data point find the predictions of each Decison Tree and assign the new data points to the category that wins the majority votes</li>
