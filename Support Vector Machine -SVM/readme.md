# Support Vector Machine 

<p> Support vector machine is used for classification as well regression problem. mainly for classifying. It is under supervised machine learning algorithm </p>

--  Goal of the svm is to create best line or decison boundary that can segregatee n dim space into classes so that we can easily put th new data point into the right category .
{Decison Boundary is called a hyperplane}

<p>SVM chooses the extreme points/vectors that help in creating the hyper plane. Those extreme points are called Support vectors.</p>

-- SVM Classify two different categories like this:

<span>Examples : Face Identification,Image Classification, Text Categorization</span>



<em> Types of SVM:</em>
<ol>Linear SVM : Linear SVM is used for linearly separable data.</ol>
<ol>Non-Linear SVM : Non-Linear SVM is used for non linearly seprated data.</ol>

<p>SVM Also support Different types of kernels {set of mathematical functions that are defined as the kernel} Which takes input and transfrom into required form.Such as Linear,NonLinear,Polynomial,Radial Basis function(RBF) and sigmoid</p>>
