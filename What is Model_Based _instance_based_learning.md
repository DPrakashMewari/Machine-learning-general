* Instance-Based Learning (Lazy Learning):
   - Instance-based learning, also known as lazy learning, is a type of learning where the model memorizes the training   instances and makes predictions based on their similarity to new instances. It does not explicitly build a general  model but stores the training data itself.
  Example: K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)


* Model-Based Learning (Eager Learning):
  - Model-based learning involves building a generalized model from the training data, capturing patterns and relationships that can be used for making predictions on new instances. The model represents a summary of the training data and is used to generalize beyond the observed instances.
   Example: Decision Tree,Linear,Logistic,SVM etc.
